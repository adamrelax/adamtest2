<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>I am a Vietnamese-Australian first-year university student, born in raised in Melbourne, Victoria currently staying in West Melbourne. Both parents originating from the South of Vietnam, having immigrated
to Australia in the early 90's. I am not religious however both parents practice Buddhism, therefore I often visit Buddhist temples across Melbourne. Undertook Primary education at Seabrook Primary School from 2007 to 2013, graduating Year 6 at
age 12. Then moved onto Secondary education at Alamanda College between 2014 and 2017, finishing there in Year 9. After that, moved to Werribee Secondary College through the IB (International Baccalaureate) Program,
a connected program between the two schools. From there, I underwent the IB program for two years, in Year 10 & 11. Then decided it wasn't for me and went into the VCE for Year 12. Graduated Year 12 at Werribee
Secondary College, being my current highest level of education. I am bi-lingual, able to speak both Vietnamese and English fluently at an advanced level. For hobbies, I indulge in many activites. One of which
includes playing Basektball for Seabrook Basketball Club. I am also currently a Black Belt First Dan in Karate, having trained at Samurai Karate Laverton for 10 years now. Other than these sporting activies, I
also enjoy playing video games such as popular MOBA title 'League Of Legends' and FPS shooters 'CS-GO' as well as 'VALORANT'. As a side hobby, I also follow the sneaker industry, buying and selling limited sneakers
via a botting program. Other than these daily activies, I am usually doing general warehouse duties at DHL or doing homework.</p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p>My interest in IT started at a young age, initially at around age 13 when I started playing around with the popular program Unity 3D. Messing around and creating small mini-games on the platform allowed
    me develop a deep interest for the field of IT. Later on, I also undertook a Software Development class as one of my highschool electives. From this elective subject, I was introducted to the idea of
    cyber-secuirty by my teacher who had suggested it as one of the most rapidly growing industries, and one that had a increasingly growing demand for experts. Although the suggestion sounded promising, I wasn't 
one hundred percent sure that I wanted to do cyber-security and wanted some flexiblity in my future. That's when I heard about the Bachelors of IT at RMIT through my careers counciller at school.
I chose this course at RMIT because it would allow me to option to go into the cyber-security field, but at the same time I am able to explore other options beforehand. Through undertaking this Information
Technology course I aim to learn about the different security systems that are used in computer programs as well as how those systems are developed. I also want to learn about the different type of cyber attacks
that often occur and how they are combated. </p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<p>My ideal job is: <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51856079?type=standout#searchRequestToken=cff0e81e-929a-4b12-81ff-a73fd15a2d95" target="_blank">https://www.seek.com.au/</a></p>

<div style="position: absolute; top:840px; left:440px; width:200px; height:25px"><h3>Cyber Security Analyst</h3></div>
<div style="position: absolute; top:900px; left:440px; width:850px; height:25px">This position is for people who want to join a rapidly growing
cyber security team and want to help protect data as well as digital infastructures. It involves staying up to date with research and evaluating
the endless amounts of emerging cyber threats. It involves the monitoring of networks and systems, dectection of security threats and then either
self-resolivng them or escalating them, subject to severity.</div>
<div style="position: absolute; top:990px; left:440px; width:850px; height:25px">This position requires the candidate to have a great amount of
experience in certain cyber related softwares and programs. It also requires knowledge on the different network security appliances that are
often used. A small amount of technical knowledge within network and web-protocols is needed (eg. TCP/IP, HTTP). The candidate needs to be open-minded 
and able to work as part of a team. However this is not all. Along with working apart of a team, the candidate should be able to openly communicate and help
develop an inclusive environment for all. This includes sharing knowledge with each other and helping each other develop as professionals. The ability to deal with
both technical and non-technical people is also very important therefore proficient written/verbal skills are essential.</div>
<div style="position: absolute; top:1140px; left:440px; width:850px; height:25px">For myself, I definately do not tick all the boxes for this sort of position
at this current time. However, I can work very well as part of a team and in fact prefer working with others as opposed to my own. I would say that I am 
generally quite open-minded and am definately happy to hear and understand others' persspectives. I am a great listener and retain information very well
when recieved auditorily. This ability is very good for this position as I can openly communicate my own ideas while at the same time understanding the
perspectives of my team when doing so. Lastly, I have the ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical people (eg. I can
explain a certain program to my older sister who is tech-savy, at the same time I can also explain it to my 65 year old father who will eventually understand,
but at a slower pace).</div>
<div style="position: absolute; top:1290px; left:440px; width:850px; height:25px">In order to obtain these skills that I do not yet have. I will undertake
this Bachelors Degree and major in security systems in my final years. However for now, I will do my own research using resources such as the 
'RMIT Information Security Collective (RISC)' discord server. Throught this I will be able to expand my knowledge on the current security threats, be it minor or major 
and also learn about the different network and web-protocols.

</div>

<div style="position:absolute; top:1840px; left:20px; width:640px; height:230px">These results don't mean much to me as I don't really trust these type of online tests, however I can say that there is some truth to these results. For the second test, I recieved a 45% in the Auditory
    learning style. This is true as I consider myself a good listener and process information better when it is recieved auditorily. Judging based of these results, in a group setting I would be more quiet and just
    analyse the task/topic at hand. These results could also suggest that I am less likely to take leadership within a group setting, and would much rather kick back and just 'go with the flow'. When forming a team
    I may consider looking for members that are more on the extroverted side, people that are able to take charge easily in order to balance out the team dynamic.</div>


<h2><div style="position:absolute; top:2030px; left:20px; width:640px; height:230px">Project Idea</div> </h2>
<div style="position:absolute; top:2092px; left:20px; width:640px; height:230px">My project will be the development of an anti-botting software that will assist and provide security for online retail stores when releasing products/items
    in limited quantity. It will act as a shield for online stores, blocking incoming requests from bot-users that aim to buy out the stores stock in the sole 
    interest of reslling and making a profit for themselves. This is often seen in hyped up merchandise releases from music artists such as American rapper 'Travis Scott' or
    Canadian rapper 'Drake'. The motivation behind this project is to support the music as well as sneaker culture in Australia. Many fans of 'Travis Scott' and 'Drake' often miss out on their favourite
    artists' merchandise due to people that operate a bot and sell-out the store within in seconds. Often these botters aren't even remotely fans of these music artists
    but they understand that there is a loyal fan-base behind this artist, and within this fan-base there are people that are willing to go above and beyond in order to
    wear their favour artist' clothing line. This is where the resale aspect comes into play, by taking advantage of the fans' passion, botters take this stock in high
    amounts and often resell it to fans for double, triple or even at times quad-triple the original retail price.


<div style="position:absolute; top:260px; left:3px; width:640px; height:230px">This project interests me greatly as I 
have a background in the sneaker/hyped merchandise world and have been reselling hyped releases for over 4 years now. Although ironic, I used to be a bot
user myself, operating a sneaker botting program called 'Nike Shoe Bot' or 'NSB' for short. I used this bot to purchase shoes off of a multitude of websites such 
Footlocker and Subtype. Although the bot was quite good at attacking these certain websites, it couldn't do everything. Additional expenses were required 
in order to operate this bot. One of which was proxies, which was used to not only to mask the location of the bot user, but also to provide a better 
network speed in the event of an International drop. Another additonal expense that was required to run this botting program was virtual debit cards, which 
were often used in bulk amounts in order to not have the same credentials in every purchase/order. Lastly, in order to not get order cancellations I had 
to spend money on an address jigger, which was a program that randomised certain letters within your home address so that overall it was the same address 
but the store's built-in system could not detect that they were the same due to the slight indifferences.</div>

<div style="position:absolute; top:523px; left:3px; width:640px; height:230px">This anti-botting program will aim to detect the use 
of jigged addresses by recognising the letters that have been switched out. I would also like it to eventually be able to detect the use of a proxy, or atleast 
deny a request if the IP address is too far from the host stores' location. In order to achieve this I will need to strengthen my knowledge in network and 
web-protocols such as HTTP's and IP's. I will also need to learn more about HTML and how websites are created in order to understand the process of purchasing products. 
I already have an understanding of the host provider 'Shopify', which is very popularly used as a website host for online stores, so that may help me in the 
development of this project. Other than this, I will need to learn about the logic behind how sites recognise addresses and somehow filter out the jigged
addresses. An advanced understanding of database software is also needed as I need to know how the data that is entered into these sites are stored (eg. name, 
address, credentials, etc). I will achieve this by putting apart some time to practise using Oracle as it is the software which Nike uses to store their data.
Overall, if this project is successful it will make the music/sneaker culture a much better place, one that is driven by passion rather than profit. It will 
make the lives of many die-hard fans and sneakerheads alike, much more fruitful and exciting. In relation to the retail stores themselves, it will help 
solve the issue of ethics when they are trying to make money. Allowing your personal merchandise to be sold in bulk to robots rather than actual fans is not 
in their interests, and this would solve that.</div>
